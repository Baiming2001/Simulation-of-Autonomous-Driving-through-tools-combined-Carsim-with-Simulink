In order to design a complete tracing methods of vehicle, including lateral control and longitudinal control schemes, a vehicle control model based on model predictive control (MPC) and optimal preview theory is chosen to be established. 

Taking the vehicle adaptive cruise (ACC) introduced as the application scenario, through the simulation experiment based on the combination of Simulink and CarSim to verify the effectiveness of the model in target speed control, safe distance maintenance, and curve steering.

More detail can be found in my project summary ,, Research on control methods of intelligent vehicles.pdf ’’ , file ‘control model in Simulink’ is picture of model in Simulink . The simulation result is also present as Animation in ‘result.avi’.
